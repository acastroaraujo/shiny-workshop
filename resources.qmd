## Resources

-   [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/)

-   [Widget Gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/widget-gallery.html)

-   [Shiny Articles](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/) (some pretty advanced stuff here, the article about exporting data *from* Shiny is useful).

-   [Shiny Gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) (check out the cool layouts)

## Tricks

-   Use `validate()` and `req()` to avoid buggy stuff.

-   [Use jobs to keep your console open and check changes automatically.](https://github.com/sol-eng/background-jobs/tree/main/shiny-job)

-   Use `reactiveConsole(TRUE)` and `input <- reactiveValues()` to see what's going on.
