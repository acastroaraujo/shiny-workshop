Scholars agree that perceptions of phenotypic traits shape how people classify others; it remains to be seen, however, whether racial classification in turn shapes people’s perceptions of phenotypic traits. The present study is based on an original survey experiment that tests whether assessments of others’ skin color are affected by a subtle racial cue, a name. Results indicate that skin color ratings are affected by the presence of a racially distinctive name: A significant share of people will rate the same face darker when that face is assigned a distinctively Hispanic name as opposed to a non-Hispanic name. In addition, ratings of male faces are more sensitive to racially distinctive names.

Although this research has advanced our knowledge of the maintenance and perceptions of racial groups, it has introduced a new question: If we are attempting to best capture the actual variation in racial inequality, how should we operationalize race? Using the 2006 wave of the Portraits of American Life Study, a national-level, in-home survey with extensive race measures and oversamples of Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians, the authors identify five ways that race can be and to varying degrees is operationalized: census, combined race/ethnic, pentagon, triracial, and skin tone measures. Using the Vuong non-nested model tests, the authors compare the effectiveness of these five measurements in predicting three measures of social inequality: household income, education, and self-rated health. The authors find that overall, Hollinger’s ethnoracial pentagon is best able to capture existing inequality. Thus, for scholars attempting to understand variation in contemporary racial inequality, this research suggests that scholars should use five monoracial categories: White, Black, Hispanic, Native American and Asian.",2016,7/16/21 16:06,7/16/21 16:06,,14-30,,1,3,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Zotero,,,,/Users/gabe/Zotero/storage/TQS2Q9GW/Howell and Emerson - Racial Measures on Markers of Social Inequality.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found support for these hypotheses across six experiments.

We used pixel variance analysis to show that these effects were not due to increased variance among Multiracial faces.

Participants categorized the race of faces that varied along White–Black morph continua and that were presented with highstatus or low-status attire. Low-status attire increased the likelihood of categorization as Black, whereas high-status attire increased the likelihood of categorization as White; and this influence grew stronger as race became more ambiguous (Experiment 1). When faces with high-status attire were categorized as Black or faces with low-status attire were categorized as White, participants’ hand movements nevertheless revealed a simultaneous attraction to select the other race-category response (stereotypically tied to the status cue) before arriving at a final categorization. Further, this attraction effect grew as race became more ambiguous (Experiment 2). Computational simulations then demonstrated that these effects may be accounted for by a neurally plausible person categorization system, in which contextual cues come to trigger stereotypes that in turn influence race perception.

In contrast, the present work leverages a nationally representative sample of Whites to examine how contextual factors may have shaped support for Trump during the 2016 presidential primaries. Results reveal that neighborhood-level exposure to racial and ethnic minorities predicts greater group threat and racial identification among Whites as well as greater intentions to vote for Trump in the general election. At the same time, however, neighborhood diversity afforded Whites with opportunities for intergroup contact, which predicted lower levels of threat, White identification, and Trump support. Further analyses suggest that a healthy local economy mutes threat effects in diverse contexts, allowing contact processes to come to the fore.",2018-04,7/16/21 16:06,7/16/21 16:06,3/26/21 0:09,275-284,,3,9,,Social Psychological and Personality Science,The Racial and Economic Context of Trump Support,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/gabe/Zotero/storage/9MR5PAJK/Knowles and Tropp - 2018 - The Racial and Economic Context of Trump Support .pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a mouse-tracking paradigm, we found in Study 1 that White individuals with low interracial exposure exhibited a unique effect of abrupt, unstable White-Black category shifting during real-time perception of mixed-race faces, consistent with predictions from a neural-dynamic model of social categorization and computational simulations. In Study 2, this shifting effect was replicated and shown to predict a trust bias against mixed-race individuals and to mediate the effect of low interracial exposure on that trust bias. Taken together, the findings demonstrate that interracial exposure shapes the dynamics through which racial categories activate and resolve during real-time perceptions, and these initial perceptual dynamics, in turn, may help drive evaluative biases against mixed-race individuals.

I use an original survey experiment to compare Americans’ stereotypes of native- and foreign-born members of the four largest ethnoracial groups in the United States—Whites, Blacks, Latinos, and Asians. As predicted by straight-line assimilation theory, I find that Whites’ negative stereotypes of Latinos fade away with nativity; however, White Americans do not substantially alter their stereotypes of Asians and Blacks based on nativity status.

Across biracial subgroups and net of all other influences, economic affluence and Jewish identity predict whiter self-identification, whereas belonging to a religion more commonly associated with racial minorities is associated with a minority identification.

Such broadening multiracial identification poses important political ramifications and raises questions about the future of minority group political solidarity. Yet we know little about the opinions of multiple-race identifiers and from where those opinions emerge. Bridging literatures in racial politics and political socialization, and drawing upon a multimethod approach, this article provides insight into the consequences of the U.S.’s increasingly blurred racial boundaries by examining the attitudes of Americans of White-Black parentage, a population whose identification was traditionally constrained by the one-drop rule. Findings show that on racial issues such as discrimination and affirmative action, biracials who identify as both White and Black generally hold views akin to Blacks. But on nonracial political issues including abortion and gender/marriage equality, biracials who identify as White-Black or as Black express more liberal views than their peers of monoracial parentage. Being biracial and labeling oneself a racial minority is thus associated with a more progressive outlook on matters that affect socially marginalized groups. Two explanations are examined for these findings: the transmission of political outlook from parents to children, and biracials’ experiences straddling a long-standing racial divide.",2016-02,7/16/21 16:06,7/16/21 16:06,3/13/21 16:05,52-67,,1,110,,Am Polit Sci Rev,Beyond Black and White,,,,,,,en,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,/Users/gabe/Zotero/storage/3HXEMPT5/Davenport - 2016 - Beyond Black and White Biracial Attitudes in Cont.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I trace the ongoing evolution of racial classifications and boundaries in the United States and Latin America, two regions that share a history of European colonization, slavery, and high levels of race mixing but that have espoused very different racial ideologies. Traditionally, for many groups in the United States, race was seen as unchangeable and determined by ancestry; in contrast, parts of Latin America have lacked strict classification rules and embraced race mixing. However, recent research has shown that race in the United States can change across time and context, particularly for populations socially defined as more ambiguous, while some Latin American racial boundaries are becoming more stringent.

Drawing on a unique data set of US-born Californians, as well as Latina/o/x Studies insight, this paper provides the first academic survey results on “Latinx” identification. We find that close to 25 percent of respondents identify with the term regularly, and that its early adoption varies across groups. Specifically, political ideology, especially progressive politics, is strongly correlated with use of the label. We also find that both immigrant generation and birth cohort matter considerably, with second generation immigrants and people born in Generation Z (since 1995) most likely to identify with the term. Finally, our findings show that “Latinx” is largely understood as complementary to, not mutually exclusive of, other panethnic labels like “Hispanic” and “Latino.” Taken together, our results suggest that generational politics matter for understanding early label diffusion and that Latinos adopt a variety of panethnic labels that they likely use in different contexts.

In this article, we present an auditing framework to guide the ethical assessment of an algorithm. The audit instrument itself is comprised of three elements: a list of possible interests of stakeholders affected by the algorithm, an assessment of metrics that describe key ethically salient features of the algorithm, and a relevancy matrix that connects the assessed metrics to stakeholder interests.

While algorithms are procedures that facilitate automated decision-making, or a sequence of unambiguous instructions, bias is a byproduct of these computations, bringing harm to historically disadvantaged populations. This paper argues that algorithmic biases explicitly and implicitly harm racial groups and lead to forms of discrimination. Relying upon sociological and technical research, the paper offers commentary on the need for more workplace diversity within high-tech industries and public policies that can detect or reduce the likelihood of racial bias in algorithmic design and execution. Design/methodology/approach The paper shares examples in the US where algorithmic biases have been reported and the strategies for explaining and addressing them. Findings The findings of the paper suggest that explicit racial bias in algorithms can be mitigated by existing laws, including those governing housing, employment, and the extension of credit. Implicit, or unconscious, biases are harder to redress without more diverse workplaces and public policies that have an approach to bias detection and mitigation. Research limitations/implications The major implication of this research is that further research needs to be done. Increasing the scholarly research in this area will be a major contribution in understanding how emerging technologies are creating disparate and unfair treatment for certain populations. Practical implications The practical implications of the work point to areas within industries and the government that can tackle the question of algorithmic bias, fairness and accountability, especially African-Americans. Social implications The social implications are that emerging technologies are not devoid of societal influences that constantly define positions of power, values, and norms. Originality/value The paper joins a scarcity of existing research, especially in the area that intersects race and algorithmic development.",2018,7/13/21 14:23,7/13/21 14:23,,252-260,,3,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Place: Bingley Publisher: Emerald Publishing Limited,,,,Racism; Social networks; Communication; Algorithms; Bias; Advertising; Artificial intelligence; Big Data; Civil race relations; Civil society; Computer ethics; Ethics; High tech industries; Machine learning; Public policy; Race and political rights,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The current datalogical turn foregrounds the digital datafication of everyday life, increasing algorithmic processing and data as an emergent regime of power/knowledge. Scholars celebrate the politics of big data knowledge production for its omnipotent objectivity or dismiss it outright as data fundamentalism that may lead to methodological genocide. In this feminist and postcolonial intervention into gender-, race- and geography-blind ‘big data’ ideologies, I call for ethical, anti-oppressive digital data-driven research in the social sciences and humanities. I argue that a reflexive data scholarship can emerge from the reintegration of feminist and postcolonial science studies and ethics of care ideals. Although it is not a panacea for all ails of data mining, I offer a road map for an alternative data-analysis practice that is more power-sensitive and accountable. By incorporating a people-centric and context-aware perspective that acknowledges relationships of dependency, reflects on temptations, and scrutinises benefits and harm, an ‘asymmetrically reciprocal’ (Young, 1997) research encounter may be achieved. I bring this perspective to bear on experiences of a two-year research project with eighty-four young Londoners on digital identities and living in a highly diverse city. I align awareness of uneven relations of power and knowledge with the messy relation of dependency between human and non-human actors in data analysis. This framework productively recognises that digital data cannot be expected to speak for itself, that data do not emerge from a vacuum, and that isolated data patterns cannot be the end-goal of a situated and reflexive research endeavor. Data-driven research, in turn, shows the urgency for renewed feminist ethical reflection on how digital mediation impacts upon responsibility, intersectional power relations, human subjectivity and the autonomy of research participants over their own data.",2017-03,7/12/21 15:48,7/12/21 15:48,,130-154,,1,115,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Arts Premium Collection; GenderWatch; Humanities Index; ProQuest Central; ProQuest One Academic; ProQuest One Literature; Social Science Premium Collection,2056433259,,,Place: London Publisher: Sage Publications Ltd.,,; ,https://libkey.io/libraries/149/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&genre=article&sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Asocscijournals&atitle=feminist+data+studies%3A+using+digital+methods+for+ethical%2C+reflexive+and+situated+socio-cultural+research&title=Feminist+Review&issn=01417789&date=2017-03-01&volume=115&issue=1&spage=130&au=Leurs%2C+Koen&isbn=&jtitle=Feminist+Review&btitle=&rft_id=info:eric/&rft_id=info:doi/10.1057%2Fs41305-017-0043-1; http://libproxy.usc.edu/login?url=https://usc.illiad.oclc.org/illiad/illiad.dll/OpenURL??ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/ProQ%3Asocscijournals&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&rft.genre=article&rft.jtitle=Feminist+Review&rft.atitle=feminist+data+studies%3A+using+digital+methods+for+ethical%2C+reflexive+and+situated+socio-cultural+research&rft.au=Leurs%2C+Koen&rft.aulast=Leurs&rft.aufirst=Koen&rft.date=2017-03-01&rft.volume=115&rft.issue=1&rft.spage=130&rft.title=Feminist+Review&rft.issn=01417789,Knowledge; Social research; Politics; Social sciences; Research; Values; Data processing; Race; young people; Reflexivity; Intersectionality; Autonomy; Geography; Big Data; Ethics; Accountability; anti-oppressive methods; Consciousness; Cultural identity; Data analysis; Data mining; data studies for social justice; Decolonization; Dependency; ethics of care; Everyday life; Feminism; feminist and postcolonial internet studies; feminist data studies; Genocide; Humanities; Ideology; Information retrieval; Intellectuals; Intervention; Mediation; Objectivity; Postcolonialism; Power; Power relationships; Production; Rehabilitation; Reintegration; Research methodology; Scholarship; Social justice; Sociocultural factors; Subjectivity; Urgency; Women's Studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
